Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
  No ReadME file. git log is a bit lacking, though there are some good descriptive commits.


Is there good spec coverage (unit and integration)?
  No spec coverage at all.

Do all specs pass?
  no specs written.

Is the application logic clear and easy to navigate?
  What is written is easy to follow and fairly clear. However it is missing a lot of needed logic.

Are objects created from a custom class with custom methods?
  Yes.

Does one instance of a class appear in the method of another class?
  Yes.

Does Sinatra process GET and POST request/responses successfully?
  The login system works correctly, so these requests are done correctly, but outside of this there weren't a lot of examples of routing.

Is the site user-friendly?
  very minimal, but easy to create an account and login.


Are there opportunities for refactoring?
  A few spots that could use work are building out the functionality, refactoring the login system to be more than just slapped onto the index page.

Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?
Talked to Kellen, they didn't get the work pushed from Day 2. This is a good start for a small amount of time though. Good use of Devise and Paperclip gems.
